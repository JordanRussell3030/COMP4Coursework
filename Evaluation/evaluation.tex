\section{Customer Requirements}

\textbf{General Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To have an interactive and easily navigable graphical user interface, applying a suitable colour scheme and layout
	\item To make the database concise and adjustable
	\item To create various lessons, with a wide range of challenges, which effectively teach students how to do trigonometry and Pythagoras
	\item To create tasks which are relevant to the lessons to be completed by the user in order to test their progress
	\item To allow this progress to be recorded in an easily accessible and readable database
	\item To incorporate algorithms which find and/or check the solution given by the user accurately and give clear and easy to read outputs to correspond with said inputs
	\item To have some access restrictions to certain levels of user
	\item To make the program accessible only from various computers with permissions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Specific Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To create a teaching program that uses the new GCSE Maths curriculum, as lots of resources will soon be out of date
	\item To include the following topics: Trigonometry, Pythagoras, 3D Trigonometry, 3D Pythagoras
	\item To include a range of difficulty levels, which can challenge every user's level of ability
	\item Use drag and drop, text boxes and drop down menus for inputs
	\item To include interactive 2D graphics which give a clearer idea of the method being shown to the user
	\item To have a database which can be accessed by different computers online
	\item Use a specific, continuous and attractive colour scheme in every window
	\item To have medium sized, highly visible icons
	\item To have all input buttons randomised to avoid double clicking and guessing from memory
	\item To have small error message windows which pop up and disappear on a timer
	\item To include images and shapes which contrast the colour scheme so they are visible and readable
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Core Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To create a teaching program that uses the new GCSE Maths curriculum, as lots of resources will soon be out of date
	\item To make the database easy to access and easy to read
	\item To include primarily trigonometry based topics, such as how to use the sine, cosine and tan rules
	\item To include an initial, moderate difficulty in order to cater for a majority of students
	\item To make the database functional and able to store the requested details
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Other Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To position buttons, text boxes and drag and drop boxes in within the layout of the graphical user interface in such a way that cheating and lucky guessing can be minimised
	\item To make the database adjustable if necessary
	\item Use a more interesting range of input types like drawing boxes rather than just clicking and typing
	\item To include a wider range of difficulties to challenge every student on the right level for them
	\item To include a wider range of topics such as pythagoras, then 3D trigonometry and 3D pythagoras
\end{itemize}
