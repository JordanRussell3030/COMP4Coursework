\section{Overall System Design}

\subsection{Short description of the main parts of the system}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{GCSE Trigonometry and Pythagoras Education System:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item General User Interface
		\item Getting Username and Password
		\item Navigating User's Personal Account User Interface
		\item Setting Homework From Administrator
		\item Running Individual Lessons
		\item Running Individual Homeworks
		\item Accepting User Inputs
		\item Outputting Error Exception Messages
		\item Recording Homework Results On Database
		\item Viewing Results in Database
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item General User Interface
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is the general layout of the interface across the system; the same layout pattern, same colour scheme, same positioning design.
		\item This will provide the user with the ability to navigate the parts of the system that they have access to, and enable them to select tasks, submit homeworks, and access the database to view their personal and homework records.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Getting Username and Password
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This will come in the very first window every time the user or administrator wants to access the program; it will ask them to log in so that they can view their own personal account, with all of their homework progress and personal records.
		\item It will mainly consist of two text boxes in the centre of the screen, one prompting a username and the other a password underneath. 
		\item If invalid information is input it will display an error message asking the user to retry. There will be no limit to the number of attempts a user can have; it won't lock them out of their computer if they keep getting it wrong.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Navigating User's Personal Account User Interface
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is essentially the functionality between each window. The user will have a range of buttons to press which will then open the relevant window, and then will have the option to return, making each part of the system accessible.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Setting Homework From Administrator
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The function which makes the user aware of which homework has been set; the administrator will set it, the system will acknowledge it, and then notify the required users to do it.
		\item The reverse will work similarly; the user will complete the homework and the administrator will be notified. They will also be notified if the user hasn't completed it before the due date.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Running Individual Lessons
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The module that runs for each lesson. Each lesson will have its own set of windows, containing the inputs, outputs and graphics to accurately represent what is being taught e.g Pythagoras Theorem.
		\item These will only be opened, navigated and closed as nothing from these is recorded in the database; they are effectively read only.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Running Individual Homeworks
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The module that runs for each homework, saved so that each different homework task is always the same, in order to avoid confusion. 
		\item When the homework is run, inputs are accepted, outputs are given, and at the end the appropriate information is recorded in the database.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Accepting User Inputs
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each input type in the system, be it the general user interface, a lesson or a homework, will be accepted.
		\item Once accepted, it will be validated, and if invalid, the appropriate error message will be displayed.
		\item Different types of inputs are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Text Boxes
			\item Drag and Drop Images
			\item Image Modification
			\item Buttons 
		\end{itemize} 
		\item If valid, the system will either allow them access to their account, or add a mark to their homework task score.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Outputting Error Exception Messages
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If a user's input is invalid, the appropriate error message will be displayed.
		\item Each error message will appear for 5 seconds and then disappear automatically.
		\item These are the variations of error messages and their causes:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Invalid Username
			\item Invalid Password
			\item Invalid Data Type
			\item Wrong Answer 1{$^s$}{$^t$}
			\item Wrong Answer 2{$^n$}{$^d$}
			\item Unauthorised Access
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Recording Homework Results On Database
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Every time a user completes a homework, the results will be recorded in the database, including the \textbf{OverallPercentScore}, \textbf{IndividualPercentScore(s)}, and \textbf{Rating}. 
		\item The user will be able to view their results in their personal database section, and the administrator will be able to view these results in the entire class database for that task.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Viewing Results in Database
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A student will be able to click a button on the home screen to take them to the database view, where they will clearly see all of their personal results
		\item A teacher will be able to click a button on the home screen to take them to the database view, where they will clearly see all of the students results in any of their own classes, and they will be able to scroll through each student in alphabetical order on a scroll bar on the side to find individual's results
		\item An administrator (teacher) can amend a database value if it is necessary, although it is unlikely that it will be
		\item A return button will take them straight back to the home page to continue using the system
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware Specification}

This system will need to run on a standard desktop computer, as generally found in schools, using the Windows 7 operating system. It will need to have a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080, a 32 bit true colour scheme, a 16:9 aspect ratio, and an Intel HD Graphics 2500 card or better, running at 60p Hz. Windows 7 is required as it is still currently the operating system used by more or less every education facility, and the client will be working at such a facility. The 32 bit true colour scheme is usually the default set by the administrators, and they need a 16:9 aspect ratio, as I need to be able to make the windows fit properly on every machine at the facility, and the screens will not be resizable. The 1920 x 1080 resolution is desirable but not entirely necessary; it is achievable and will maintain the quality of the appearance of the program. The Intel HD Graphics 2500 is standard and should be able to run the system. A keyboard will be required for inputting text answers into boxes throughout the lessons, homework, and for logging in; any standard keyboard will be usable for this. Similarly, any standard mouse will be needed for navigating the GUI, clicking buttons, scrolling, using frop down boxes and dragging and dropping. A standard display will be used for the output of the system; just visual, no audio. The data for each user will be stored on a local server so that every user or administrator can view their own/all data from any of the machines at the facility. All of these requirements are able to be met by the client, who has it all available.

\subsection{Identification of appropriate storage media}

My system files will need to be stored on the school's local server, as every part will need to be accessible from every computer, to save the teacher having to log into every computer one at a time to check work. this way, every computer can access every account, and if they have the permissions, every part of the database. If necessary, some files can be backed up onto an individual computer in the system, or onto a USB stick. As a result, all users and administrators will be able to share the files and use them at the same time.

\section{Security and Integrity of the System and Data}

\subsection{Security and Integrity of Data}

As this system will store a small amount of personal data (FirstName, LastName, ClassID), the Data Protection Act of 1998 must be followed. Therefore the data must be kept up to date, and a way of editing the FirstName, LastName and ClassID records will be included to ensure that wrong data is not forced to be kept permanently, should it be input by mistake. To ensure that the data is not kept for longer than the DPA says it should be, any old data will be searched for and deleted whenever the system is started, should it be found. Furthermore, checks shall be implemented to ensure key data fields are not left empty, in order to maintain referential integrity. The only possible way to view the data stored by my system will be on the visual database in the graphical user interface, which will only be accessible following the input of a correct username and password. Finally, all of the data stored will be valid and feasible as drop down menus, and data type relevant error messages will be used to ensure the user is given a fair chance to input answers.

\subsection{System Security}

In order to prevent theft of information and tampering, all information in the system will only be accessible by providing a username and password, and each user will only be allowed to view data relevant to their own progression. Students will not be able to change any information in the database, but teachers will, if they accidentally include a typo when inputting names into the system. Furthermore, the number of people with access to the system will be limited, and those with key access trusted as professional teachers. The database will be encrypted to avoid people somehow accessing the database information by some other means, although only names will be stored as personal information. Lastly, all of the names input into the system will have a validation check to ensure they do not accidentally include numbers, extra capital letters, not enough capital letters or other characters not in the alphabet. Because the names stored will fall under the Data Protection Act, I will ensure that no data is sent to other countries, or even anywhere at all outside of the school, that the data is secure and only accessible by authorised people, that it is only stored by the school, that the data can be updated and destroyed to ensure protection, and that only necessary data will be collected in the first place.

\section{Validation}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|} \hline
\textbf{Item} & \textbf{Example} & \textbf{Validation applied} & \textbf{Comments} \\ \hline
ClassID & 10A & Presence check & The ClassID is the same as the classes actual class name, so no validation is required \\ \hline
FirstName & John & Data type check: First letter, capital, rest lower case, all string, no spaces & Checks that the name given is in fact a name \\ \hline
